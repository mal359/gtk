  * GNOME team upload.
  * Add a static list of Uploaders for the GNOME team.

    (closes: #267815).
  * Patch the file selector to do file autocompletion like every other
    application (thanks, Matt Zimmerman, even if you don't care at all
    only because the patch is 3 years old and everyone is using GTK2
    anyway :) closes: #148565).

  * New upstream version.  
  * This new version fixes all locale-related bugs recently
    reported.  Note that if you don't want high ASCII characters to 
    be silently munched with glibc 2.2, at least set LANG=en_US to
    get it away from the default to C, which no longer allows high
    ASCII characters.  (Closes: #74796, #77263, #89379, #90776, #89125,
    #89129, #89806)
  * Build with --with-native-locale=yes.  Should fix all locales-related
    segfaults recently reported. (But if you want high ASCII chars
    to appear when using libc 2.2, you should set LANG=en_US at least,
    or it'll default to LANG=C and filter all high ASCII characters!)
    (Closes: #89125, #89129)
  * Add support in debian/rules for adding -g and not stripping if
    DEB_BUILD_OPTIONS contains "debug" or "nostrip", respectively.
    (Closes: #33952, #34007)
  * Remove dependancy on gconv-modules. (Closes: #89082)

    to allow parallel installation with gtk+ 2.0.  Remember to
    use gtk-config to compile programs!
  * A note from upstream says that there were a lot of locale fixes
    in this release.  Let's hope so!
  * Setuid/setgid GTK+ programs will now refuse to initialize.  Remember
    to drop all setuid/setgid privileges before initializing GTK+!
  * Several out-of-date documents were removed upstream: gdk-tutorial
    and gtk-manual are available online now.
  * About the FAQ missing page bugs: the pages just don't seem to
    get generated from the SGML no matter what I do; I'm not
    removing them by hand or anything.  I'll spend more time looking
    into this later..
